<h1>Terms of Service</h1>

<h2>Use of the Service</h2>
<p>
Clutch Calendar allows you to automatically create class schedule events on your Google Calendar.
You may only use this service for lawful purposes and in compliance with university policies.
</p>

<h2>Google Calendar Access</h2>
<p>
To function, the app requires permission to create events in your Google Calendar
(using the scope <code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events</code>).
We do not read, modify, or access any other calendar data.
