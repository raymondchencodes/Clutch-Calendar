<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: November 2025</strong></p>

<p>
Clutch Calendar is a tool that helps users automatically add their university class 
schedule to Google Calendar. We care about your privacy and collect as little information 
as possible.
</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When you use Google Sign-In, we request access to the 
        <strong>Calendar Events</strong> scope 
        (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events</code>).</li>
    <li>This permission allows the app to create events on your Google Calendar.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or access:
        <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>Your email</li>
            <li>Your password</li>
            <li>Your Google account information</li>
            <li>Any existing calendar data beyond the events we generate</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Your class schedule is temporarily stored in your browser session and on our server 
        session <strong>only long enough to create events</strong>.</li>
    <li>After the events are created, the schedule is immediately cleared from the server session.</li>
    <li>No data is logged, saved, sold, or used for analytics or advertising.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
<p>
Clutch Calendar does <strong>not</strong> share, sell, transfer, or disclose any user data to any 
third party outside of Google services required for the application to function.
</p>
<p>
The only third party involved is Google, and the only data accessed is the permission 
required to create calendar events that you request. No data is shared with advertisers, 
analytics providers, or external services.
</p>

<h2>Data Protection & Security</h2>
<p>
We take data protection seriously. To safeguard your information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>All communication between Clutch Calendar and Google APIs is encrypted using 
        <strong>HTTPS/TLS</strong>.</li>
    <li>Temporary session data is stored only in memory and is automatically cleared after use.</li>
    <li>No user data is stored in any database, file system, or persistent storage.</li>
    <li>No sensitive information is ever logged on the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Because we do not retain any personal data after your session ends, all sensitive 
information remains under your control.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
We use the Google Calendar API solely to create recurring events based on your class 
schedule. We do not modify, read, or access any other calendar events.
</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
    <li>No personal data is stored after your session ends.</li>
    <li>No user information is saved in any database.</li>
</ul>
